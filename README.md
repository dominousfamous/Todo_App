# Todo App
#### Node.js, Express.js, MongoDb, CSS, EJS
## Description
- Starter app to get me comfortable with the JavaScript frameworks
- Backend focused (no React in this application)

### What I did
- Used express-session to authenticate users
- Used mongoose to create a user schema
- Updated and retrieved data from mongodb atlas

## Conclusion
- Basic yet very fun project for me
- Helped me understand nosql databases more
- Realized one advantage of a node application is that the backend and frontend can all be written in the same language
